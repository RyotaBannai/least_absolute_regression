Title

How to get cool badges for your scientific workflow

Description

Modern science demands that scientific results
and workflows must be reproducible and transparent whenever possible.
We have found that many tools and services designed for open software
development are also useful for developing open and reproducible science.
This talk describes how Jupyter fits in
with other standard tools and services in reproducible science projects
we have developed.

The talk will outline a methodology for publishing scientific workflows
via:

- Jupyter notebooks for repeatable computational experimentation.
- Cookiecutter for hardening code components into publishable modules.
- Git and Github as a platform for code collaboration/distribution
and an infrastructure for other services.
- Travis continuous integration for validating workflows in different
environments.
- Using Jupyter notebooks as executable documentation.
- Code coverage interfaces for assessing test quality.
- Docker containers for distributing complete computational environments.
- Using repo2docker to easily build docker containers.
- Using Binder with Jupyter to allow anyone to try your workflow without installing
anything.
